### Basic Snake Tutorial

Insert into the code panel the following code and click play.

```javascript
function move(req) {
    console.log('movement')
    return 'left'
}
```

This will instruct our snake to always move to the left no matter what. Now if
we click "Play" we'll see our snake consistently move to the left as well as
logs being output with out log statement that we typed in. If you click "replay"
in the game frame, you'll be able to watch the game over again.
